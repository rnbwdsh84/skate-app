                <p class="aboutP">The Australian Skateboarding Association was founded in 1984 by a group 
                of like minded skateboarders who saw the need to create a ruling body as the industry 
                exploded in popularity. Since that day our number one goal is to support skateboarders.
                Maintain a healthy relationship with the broader community by educating skaters in good 
                conduct and teaching the broader community about skate culture, welcoming them with open arms.
